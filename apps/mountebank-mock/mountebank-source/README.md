# Welcome, friend

mountebank is the only open source service virtualization tool that competes with the commercial offerings
in terms of protocol diversity, capability, and performance. Here's what
[Capital One wrote](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/moving-one-of-capital-ones-largest-customer-facing-apps-to-aws-668d797af6fc)
about their mobile cloud migration (emphasis theirs):

>In fact, halfway through we discovered our corporate mocking software couldnâ€™t handle the
>sheer amount of performance testing we were running as part of this effort (_we completely crushed
>some pretty industrial enterprise software in the process_). As a result, we made the call to move

At the moment, the following protocols are implemented, either directly in the tool or as a community extension:
* http
* https
* tcp (text and binary)
* smtp
* ldap
* grpc
* websockets
* graphql
* snmp
* telnet
* ssh
* netconf

mountebank supports mock verification, stubbing with advanced predicates, JavaScript injection,
and record-playback through proxying.

See [getting started](https://www.mbtest.org/docs/gettingStarted) guide for more information.

## Install and Run

Install:

    npm install -g mountebank

Run:

    mb

There are a number of [command line options](https://www.mbtest.org/docs/commandLine) if you need
to customize mountebank.

All pre-release versions of mountebank are available with the `beta` [npm tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mountebank).
No `beta` version is published unless it has passed all tests.

You can always learn more and support mountebank development by buying the book:

## Roadmap and Support

mountebank is used by a large number of companies and I think it's important to convey my best guess as to what
the feature roadmap is. I've adopted GitHub tools to manage the roadmap. Specifically, the
[Roadmap project](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank/projects/9) page shows the features by release. I generally
re-prioritize and update the ETAs each release.

Visit the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mountebank-discuss)
for any support questions.  Don't be shy!

mountebank is provided free of charge and maintained in my free time. As such, I'm unable to make any kind
of guarantees around either support turn-around time or release dates.

## Building

There are two packages: mountebank itself, and a test package called mbTest (which houses all
out-of-process tests against mountebank). First ensure all dependencies are installed for both packages:

    npm install

Then, run all tests:

    npm test

Several other test configurations exist. You can see the CI pipeline in .circleci/config.yml.

There are some tests that require network access.
A few of these tests verify the correct behavior under DNS failures.  If your ISP
is kind enough to hijack the NXDOMAIN DNS response in an attempt to allow you to conveniently peruse their
advertising page, those tests will fail.  I suggest that, under such circumstances, you talk to your ISP
and let them know that their policies are causing mountebank tests to fail. You can also set
the environment variable `MB_AIRPLANE_MODE=true`, which will avoid tests requiring your DNS resolver.

## Support

I make a good faith effort to monitor conversations in the [mountebank Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/mountebank-discuss).
Given that mountebank is a free tool freely maintained in my (increasingly limited) free time,
I make no promises about response time (or responses at all).
